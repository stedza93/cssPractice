            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
                packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum'
                will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
                by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Miusov, as a man man of breeding and deilcacy,
                could not but feel some inwrd qualms, when he reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he felt ashamed of
                havin lost his temper. He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch,
                too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself. "Teh monks
                were not to blame, in any case," he reflceted, on the steps. "And if they're decent people here (and the
                Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won't argue,
                I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politness, and show them that I've nothing to do with that
                Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have." He
                determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery
                rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he
                had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were. These excellant intentions were strengthed
                when he enterd the Father Superior's diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for
                the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable
                than Father Zossima's. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture
                was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stained,
                but evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most
                sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean,
                the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead,
                and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There
                was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served
                with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote,
                and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping
                into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about
                everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities,
                and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sort,
                but Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and
                quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey
                left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced
                him in that. Rakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to
                which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They
                were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside,
                waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall,
                thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He
                bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to
                kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went
                through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do. "We
                must apologize most humbly, your reverance," began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified
                and respecful tone. "Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch.
                He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima's
                cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out
                of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as" -- he glanced at the monks -- "your reverance is, no doubt,
                already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and
                begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes
                and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place." As
                he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces
                of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again. The Father Superior listened
                to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied: "I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps
                at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen." He stood before the
                holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands
                before him, with peculier fervor.
